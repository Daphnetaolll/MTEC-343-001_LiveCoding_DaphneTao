# Proposal: *Eulerroom A Global Stage for Live Coding*

## Introduction
This presentation introduces **Eulerroom**, an international community and platform for live coding. Live coding is the real-time writing of code to generate music and visuals, with artists often sharing their screens so the process is visible. Since 2019, Eulerroom has become a central hub for the global live coding scene, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when it hosted worldwide streaming festivals.

## Background
- Origins: Live coding emerged in the early 2000s (TOPLAP, Slub).  
- Expansion: The Algorave movement brought algorithmic music into clubs.  
- Eulerroom: A decentralized, community-driven stage connecting performers across time zones.  

## Focus
1. **History** – Growth from small events to global festivals.  
2. **Features** – Screen-sharing, 24-hour relay sets, inclusive participation.  
3. **Case Studies** – *Eulerroom Equinox* and *Solstice* festivals.  
4. **Cultural Impact** – Openness, collaboration, and diversity in digital arts.  

## Relevance
Eulerroom shows how digital platforms reimagine performance and community. As an electronic musician and performer, I find its distributed model inspiring for future creative practice.  

## Conclusion
Eulerroom demonstrates how grassroots initiatives can evolve into a global stage, embodying the openness and experimentation that define live coding today.
