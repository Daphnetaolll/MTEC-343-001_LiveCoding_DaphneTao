# Reading Reflection: Introduction to *Live Coding: A User’s Manual*

## Two things that were new/surprising to me
1. **“If we follow this logic, then we do not use computers; they use us.”**  
   This inversion of agency surprised me because I usually think of computers as tools we control. The text reframed this relationship, suggesting that computers (and the infrastructures behind them) shape us just as much as we shape them.

2. **“This way of computing ... helps me ‘unthink’ the engineering I do as my day job.”**  
   I was struck by the idea of relating to computers more like plants something to be cultivated and experimented with, rather than just engineered or optimized. This metaphor was unexpected and expanded my view of how coding can be approached creatively.

## Two things that were not new/didn’t surprise me
1. **“Live coding is about people interacting with the world, and each other, in real time, via code.”**  
   This aligns with what I already knew that live coding emphasizes liveness, performance, and improvisation as social acts. It didn’t surprise me, but it reinforced the importance of immediacy and interaction.

2. **“But a live coding musician is like an improvising composer, able to transform the whole structure of the piece with a few keystrokes.”**  
   I was already familiar with the improvisatory nature of live coding in music, where the coder performer composes and performs simultaneously. This analogy to improvisation felt natural and unsurprising given my background in electronic performance.
