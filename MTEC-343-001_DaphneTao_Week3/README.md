# Eulerroom as a Pandemic Era Stage




## INTRO
- Venues closed and community moved online  
- Global but simple: laptops, living rooms, relay across time zones  
- how Eulerroom turned crisis into a working continuous stage



## The Pivot
- Lockdowns & gigs canceled
- Fast response: open sign up & time zone chain  
- “Telefestival” vibe: one ends, next begins, no dead air  
- Gave artists and audience a place to meet



## What “Stage” Meant
- A simple pipeline:
  - Sign up: slot in your local time  
  - Clear stream steps  
  - Host handoff  
  - Archive after each set on playlist




## The Feel
- Screen & sound: code, music, watch fixes  
- Chat is the room: cheer, Q&A, links  
- Sun-chasing schedule 



## Case: Equinox
- Early template worked:
  - Clear running order & short sets  
  - Hosts solve issues backstage  
  - Full playlist archive afterward
- Shareable, learnable



## Case: Solstice
- Same spirit, seasonal mood & “longest night”
- smoother handoffs, longer hours  
- community habit



## Why It Worked
- Low friction: no travel/visas/soundcheck lines  
- Visible process: experiments normal, mistakes okay  
- Archives: links for friends  
- Volunteer ops: tech help, time zones, gentle moderation



## Limits & Workarounds
- Home net drops, crunchy audio, basic cams  
- Short sets: quick reset, hosts fill gaps  
- Rough edges turn to bedroom broadcast aesthetic



## The End
- Not just “online shows” stage can be software & people
- Turned distance into connection & practice into community  
- Still useful for hybrid shows, remote collabs, class showcases  
- Set schedule, press Go Live, pass the baton
